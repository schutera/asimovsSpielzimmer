Welcome to **asimovsSpielzimmer** ‚Äì your SO101 robot's playground! 

Yeah, we know‚Äîteleoperating your robot arm is fun and all. But let's face it‚Äîyour foundation model (looking at you [smolVLA](https://huggingface.co/lerobot/smolvla_base)) still behaves like a teenager losing coordination skills during a growth spurt ([see related research ‚Äì I am not a physician](https://www.biomedcentral.com/about/press-centre/science-press-releases/20-05-16)).

Yes, you‚Äôll need a lot of data to get anywhere near generalization. Our solution takes away the chore of recording for imitation learning. Describe a task template once, generate high-variance data, duct tape it to your simulation, and record huge datasets that are out-of-the-box compatible with the [LeRobot framework](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot).

Push it up to Huggingface ü§ó and train your robot.

## üöÄ What is this?

**asimovsSpielzimmer** (‚ÄúAsimov‚Äôs Playroom‚Äù in German) is a toolkit designed to automatically generate diverse and realistic robot simulation configurations using OpenAI‚Äôs GPT models.  
Ideal for researchers, enthusiasts, and anyone looking to streamline the creation of large-scale, varied robot datasets fresh from the simulation press and ready to be plugged into the LeRobot Framework.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **LLM-powered config generation**: Uses GPT-4o to create simulation configs from task templates.
- **Randomization**: Ensured randomness for robust and varied environments.
- **Easy extensibility**: Add your own tasks and templates.
- **Modern Pythonic codebase**: Clean, modular, and ready for hacking.
- **Aynchronous generation**: Load pregenerated configurations with your existing simulation pipelines.

## üõ†Ô∏è Quickstart

1. **Clone this repo**  
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/asimovsSpielzimmer.git
    cd asimovsSpielzimmer
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**  
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Use existing task templates** 
    ```bash
    # Example: Generate simulation configs from the command line
    python generate_sim_config.py \
        --task_type="push_cube_to_cube" \
        --num_episodes=1
    ```

This will generate 3 simulation configs for the `push_cube_to_cube` task using the templates in `task_info.json`.  
Configs are saved automatically for each episode.

4. **Customize or add your own task templates**  
See [`task_info.json`](task_info.json) for examples.  
Add new YAML templates to extend functionality. Make sure to enable your simulation to digest the templates as well.
